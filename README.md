# ccid-tsr-importer

This repository contains tools for import and summarisation of data collected during The Strategy Room sessions.

> The Strategy Room is an immersive experience which uses facilitated discussion and social psychology to find out what non-experts really think about climate change policies. Itâ€™s a way for someone to walk in off the street and within 90 minutes, to imagine the benefits of a Net Zero future, and to have their say on how we get there.

## Repository contents

The [tsr-importer-app](tsr-importer-app/) directory contains a CloudFormation application with functions to import data uploaded to s3 from TSR sessions, summarise and store that data by demographic, and then present that data for consumption by [The Strategy Room data visualisation platform](https://strategyroom.uk).
